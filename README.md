# Jaya-Optimization-Algorithm
The Jaya algorithm is a metaheuristic which is capable of solving both constrained and unconstrained optimization problems. It is a population-based method which repeatedly modifies a population of individual solutions. It is a gradient-free optimization algorithm. It does not contain any hyperparameters.
